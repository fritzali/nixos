## NixOS Installation

The goal of this is a stable, partially encrpyted and somewhat flexible initial NixOS setup to build upon. In order to include a full description, large parts are not specific to NixOS and can be adopted for other systems as well. The process consists of the following steps:

#### Booting

#### Partitioning

- BOOT (UEFI)
- SWAP
- EXT4 (LVM)

#### Encrypting

- LUKS

#### Installing
